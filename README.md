# Regression_Simplified
This repository was created for CX 4803 CML (Computational Foundations of Machine Learning) at Georgia Tech for Fall 2024 and contains my visualizations and implementations of Regression and Classification Models using statistics, calculus and Linear Algebra, with no usage of pre-built ML libraries. The only libraries used in implementations are Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
